(1),Under the GHG,"Protocol33, there a",re two method,s to calculate,Scope,2 emissions fro,m electricity: location-ba,sed and mark,et-base,d. The GHG Protoc,ol Scope 2
,Guidance define,s the location-bas,ed method as,a method for,Scope,2 emissions acc,ounting that reflects emi,ssions from e,lectricit,y using the average,emission
,factors for the e,lectricity grids tha,t are providin,g electricity to,the or,ganization's fac,ilities. The GHG Protocol,Scope 2 Guid,ance de,fines the market-b,ased method as
,a method for Sc,ope 2 emissions a,ccounting that,reflects emiss,ions fr,om electricity t,hat a reporting company,has purposel,y chose,n (or their lack of c,hoice). In the
,market-based m,"ethod, emissions",factors are de,rived from con,tractu,"al instruments, i",ncluding “any type of co,ntract betwee,n two p,arties for the sale a,nd purchase of
,energy bundled,with attributes ab,out the energy,"generation, o",r for u,nbundled attribu,"te claims”. As such, to c",alculate the S,cope 2,market-based emis,"sions, our"
,indirect energy,consumed (measu,red in MWh) i,s matched with,RECs,sourced from w,"ithin the same region, an",d the emissio,ns mea,surement is adjust,ed based on the
,emissions facto,r for the RECs sou,rced.,,,,,,,,

(3),"Under Scope 3,",RBC reports the e,missions resul,ting from empl,oyees’,business travel,calculated according to,Category 6 of,the GH,G Protocol3 3. Scope,3 emissions for
,employee busin,ess travel is based,on bookings t,hrough a third,-party,system and thro,ugh travel agencies. It i,s aggregated,and con,verted into emissio,ns based on
,either fuel usag,e or distance conv,ersion. Emissi,ons factors us,ed are,sourced from pu,blicly available governm,ent sources.,Data is,representative of R,BC’s Scope 3
,employee busin,ess travel globally,. The reportin,g cycle for Sco,pe 3 em,issions remain,s November 1 to October,31. Conversel,"y, the re",porting cycle for o,ur Scope 1 & 2
