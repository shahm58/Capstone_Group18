RBC set a goal,in 2019,to increase our,sourcing of el,ectricit,y from renewable and n,on-emitting,sources to,
100% by 2025.,We have,since replaced,this with a g,oal to s,ource 100% renewable e,lectricity an,d revised ou,r
methodology t,o measu,re progress ag,ainst this goal,to alig,n with RE100 Principles3,"2, as further",described in,
Restatement o,f our em,issions from op,erations. In 2,"024, we",met our goal of sourcin,g 100% o,f our electric,ity
from renewab,le sourc,es. This was ac,hieved by sour,cing en,ergy attribute certificat,"es (EACs), i",n line with,
RE100 Principl,"es, such",as renewable e,nergy certific,ates (R,"EC), and power purchas",e agreemen,"ts (PPAs), as",
further descri,bed belo,w.,,,,,,

Overview of s,trategic,actions,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
As we continu,e to focu,s on delivering,emissions red,uction,"s in our operations, we a",re working,toward long,er-
term reductio,ns throu,gh two strategi,"c actions, as o",utlined,below.,,,
,,,,,,,,
1. Reducing,emission,s from fossil f,uel consumpt,ion,,,,
,,,,,,,,
RBC is focusin,g on red,ucing heating f,uel emissions,in both,the buildings we own a,nd those we,lease. In 20,"24,"
we announced,plans t,o install heat pu,mps in our Ca,nadian,branch network where,we are resp,onsible for,
HVAC by 2035.,Over th,e next three yea,rs (2025-2027,"), RBC i",s investing $35 million in,to this effo,rt. Through t,his
"initiative, we a",re worki,ng to replace o,"ver 1,500 HVA",C units,across our retail networ,k.,,
,,,,,,,,
In spaces we l,ease wh,ere we do not h,ave control o,ver the,"HVAC equipment, we ar",e working w,ith landlords,to
help reduce e,missions,through our La,ndlord Engag,ement,Program. This involves i,dentifying m,easures to,
reduce emissi,ons whe,n designing ma,jor renovation,s and n,ew builds where RBC le,"ases space,",such as,
electrifying he,ating an,d cooling. We a,lso continue t,o prom,ote energy efficiency in,our owned,and leased,
buildings thro,ugh mea,sures such as s,mart building,techno,"logies (e.g., smart therm",ostats).,,
,,,,,,,,
2. Increasin,g the ge,neration of ren,ewable energ,y,,,,
,,,,,,,,
We plan to co,ntinue to,source 100% o,f our electrici,ty from,"renewable energy, with",the aim of s,ourcing fro,m
the regions in,which w,e operate. This,helps to stimu,late th,e market for renewable,energy and,supports th,e
broader decar,bonizati,on of the electr,icity grids we,rely on,. RBC procures renewab,le electricit,y through lo,ng-
"term PPAs, on",site rene,wable energy p,"rojects, and o",ther so,urces of RECs. As RBC c,ontinues to,source RECs,","
we will look to,support,new projects t,hat create ad,ditional,ity and provide social b,enefits.,,
,,,,,,,,
RBC is also w,orking to,address emis,sions from bu,siness,travel and our supply,"chain, such",as through,
the purchase,of Susta,inable Aviatio,n Fuel and ex,ploring,the opportunity to est,ablish a su,pplier,
engagement p,rogram,.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Carbon credit,investm,ents,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
While RBC pri,oritizes e,missions reduc,tions in our o,peratio,"ns, we also purchase an",d retire car,bon credits t,o
compensate f,or our re,sidual reported,operational e,missio,ns (as described in Tabl,e 16: Global,emissions fr,om
our operation,"s, for the",year ended Oc,tober 31). Carb,on cre,dits are not counted for,purposes o,f measuring,our
reported annu,al opera,tional emission,s. We believe,purcha,sing carbon credits tha,t demonstra,te key quali,ties
such as additi,onality a,nd permanenc,e provide capi,tal to s,upport projects that con,tribute to c,limate actio,n;
"for example, b",y helpin,g to scale new t,echnologies o,r expa,nd natural carbon sinks.,To support,these,
"objectives, RB",C is one,of the founding,buyers of car,bon re,moval credits from Deep,Sky’s first,commercial,
direct air capt,ure proj,"ect in Canada, a",greeing to pu,rchase,"5,000 carbon removal c",redits over,a period of 1,0
years.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
RBC purchase,s credits,from third-par,ty verified pro,jects a,nd technologies that hel,p reduce em,issions. The,
carbon credits,are veri,fied by third-pa,rty carbon cr,edit reg,istries such as Climate,Action Rese,"rve, Verra, a",nd
American Car,bon Regi,"stry, as well as",additional thi,rd-part,y validation/verification,"bodies, and",fulfill the,
criteria of the,carbon c,redit registries,to demonstra,te addi,tionality and permanen,ce. We cond,uct due,
diligence as p,art of ou,r procurement,process and t,ake into,"account location, tech","nology, vint",age and,
additional com,munity,and/or environ,mental benefi,ts and i,mpacts.,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"In 2024, we pu",rchased,and retired car,bon credits of,"60,","368 tonnes of CO e (tCO
2","e), which is
2",equivalent,to
the total mark,et-based,emissions fro,m our own ope,ration,"s for 2024 (2023: 88,729;","2022: 68,471",). The carbo,n
credits purcha,sed and,retired in 2024,are to match,the 202,4 total market-based e,missions an,d are not,
applied to prio,r years’,emissions due,to restatemen,ts. Ref,er to Restatement of em,issions from,our operati,ons
