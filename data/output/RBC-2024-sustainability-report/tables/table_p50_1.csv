,,,,,,,
,,Our oil and,gas Scope 1 & 2 physi,cal emissions intensity has,decreased,by 8% compared,to our 2019
,,baseline. T,his is driven by factor,s such as continued shifts in,our portfo,lio with reduced,lending to
,,some of ou,r more emissions-inte,"nsive clients, increased len",ding to clie,nts with lower em,"issions,"
,,decarboniz,ation efforts by client,"s, M&A activity within the s","ector, less r",eliance on emiss,ions estimates
,,and natural,fluctuations in our p,ortfolio when viewed at a si,ngle point i,n time (fiscal yea,r-end).
,,Progress ha,s been limited to dat,e on this Interim Target due,in part to s,lower than antici,pated
,,adoption of,decarbonization tec,"hnology, such as carbon ca","pture, as we",ll as limited gove,rnment policy
,,to support t,he decarbonization o,f the sector.,,,
,,,,,,,
,,RBC’s Interi,m Target for this sec,tor is informed by Canada’s,Emissions R,eduction Plan (E,RP) which
,,describes t,he measures that are,intended to ensure that Ca,nada reduce,s emissions acr,oss the entire
,,economy to,reach its emissions,reduction target of 40 to 45,percent bel,ow 2005 levels b,y 2030 and put
,,Canada on,a path to achieve net,-zero emissions by 2050. We,believe thi,"s Interim Target,",while not
,,aligned to a,science-based 1.5°C,temperature outcome path,"way, is supp",ortive of our ulti,mate ambition
,,to achieve,net-zero in our lendin,"g by 2050, especially in conj",unction wit,h the actions we,are taking to
,,reduce our,absolute financed em,issions in the sector over ti,me (as desc,ribed above). As,we review our
,,Interim Tar,"gets, we will assess t",he appropriate approach to,subsequent,interim targets t,o achieve our
,,ultimate am,bition to achieve net,-zero in our lending by 2050,.,,

,,Physical e,missions intensity ta,rget: Oil and gas (Scope 3),,,
,,,,,,,
,,Our oil and,gas Scope 3 physical,emissions intensity has inc,reased by 5,% compared to o,ur 2019
,,baseline. T,his increase is due in,part to better availability of,client repo,rted emissions d,ata in more
,,recent year,s which tends to be h,igher than emissions proxy,values. Pro,gress on this Inte,rim Target
,,relies on ch,anges to the emissio,ns associated with the end u,se of oil an,d gas products (,"e.g., increased"
,,proportion,used as non-combust,ion petrochemical feedstoc,k). Progres,s on this Interim,Target has
,,been slow g,iven the overall pace,of the transition. Despite b,etter availa,bility of client re,ported
,,emissions d,"ata, we continue to r",ely heavily on emissions pro,xies.,,
