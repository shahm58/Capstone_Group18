Access to financing is re,quired to prom,ote th,e innovation and a,doption of,solutions need,ed for the,
transition. Certain solut,ions for climate,mitig,ation are in the ea,rly stages o,f technologica,l or market matur,ity
and are not yet suitable,for bank financ,ing. In,vesting in climate,solutions a,llows RBC to s,upport innovation,at
earlier stages than thro,ugh traditional l,endin,g arrangements al,one. RBC’s,investments s,upport companies,
whose goals are to deve,lop and scale c,limate,solutions.,,,,

(1) Cumulative climate investment,commitments at the end,of 2024 h,ave been revalued using the,spot exchange r,"ate as at October 31, 20","24. During 2024, RBC made",one
new commitment of $21 million.,"The remaining increase,",$1 million,", is due to the impact of fore",ign exchange tra,nslation.,,
(2) While our approach may evolve,over time under this cat,egory of i,"nvestment, we intend to prio",ritize allocating c,apital toward solution,s that will lead to GHG,
emissions reductions in Canada,and globally. Our invest,ment com,mitments eligible to count t,owards this goal,may also include suppo,rt for climate solutions wit,h
"outcomes linked to biodiversity,",nature and/or adaptatio,"n, among",others. We aspire to achiev,e this goal by 203,"0; however, market co","nditions, among other facto",rs –
many of which are beyond our c,ontrol and the effects of,which ca,n be difficult to predict – cou,ld impact our abi,lity to invest capital to,advance climate solutions,over
this timeframe. For more details,", refer to Appendix 8: Ca",ution reg,arding forward-looking state,ments and Appen,dix 9: Important notice,regarding this report. For,
purposes of tracking progress to,"wards this goal, our elig",ible inves,tment commitments made fr,om 2022 onward,are included.,,
