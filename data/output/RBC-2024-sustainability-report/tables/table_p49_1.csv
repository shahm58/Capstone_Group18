"In 2024, 48% of",the business,mix of these en,"tities,",as measured b,y revenue or anoth,er available proxy,","
represented low,-carbon act,"ivities, an increa",se fro,m 46% in 2023.,"However, because",most of our lendi,ng to
these entities is,in the form,of general corp,orate p,"urpose loans, i",t is difficult to dete,rmine how much,of the
funds we lend a,re allocated,to low-carbon v,ersus,high-carbon act,ivities.,,

We measure pr,ogress of our,lending to high,-carbo,n energy client,s both in terms of:,,

Absolute finan,ced emissio,ns (oil and gas,only),,,,
,,,,,,,
As part of the tr,ansition to a,low-carbon eco,"nomy,",absolute financ,ed emissions from t,he oil and gas sec,tor
should decline o,ver time. Ab,solute financed,emissi,ons measures t,otal financed emiss,ions associated w,ith our
authorized lend,ing to the oil,and gas sector.,This pr,ovides a view o,f whether absolute,emissions from th,e
sector are incre,asing or decr,easing over tim,e. It als,o measures the,impact of actions,we are taking to b,ring
down our absol,ute financed,emissions from,the sec,tor over time th,rough RBC’s Client,Engagement Appr,oach

For the year en,ded October,"31, 2024, Scope","1, 2, an",d 3 absolute fin,"anced emissions15,",on an authorized,"basis,"

Interim Targets,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
We set Interim,Targets in 20,22 for three key,sector,"s – oil and gas,","power generation,",and automotive,– using
"data, methodol","ogies, climat",e scenarios and,other,information av,ailable to us at the,time.,
,,,,,,,
When we publis,hed our Inte,"rim Targets, we",stated,that they were,aspirational and b,ased on certain,
assumptions we,believed to,be reasonable,at the t,"ime, including",assumptions about,future stakehold,er
actions outside,of our contr,"ol, and that our",ability,to achieve thes,e Interim Targets,would depend on,the
collective effort,s and action,s across a wide,range,of stakeholder,"s, including our clie",nts and policyma,kers.
We also acknow,ledged that,these assumpti,ons ma,y subsequently,turn out to be ina,"ccurate, given the",ir
inherent uncert,ainty and co,"mplexity, and th",at the,Interim Targets,may need to be ch,anged and may n,ot be
achieved.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
We believe that,the facts an,d circumstance,s upon,which we set o,ur Interim Targets,have since chang,"ed, and"
that assumptio,ns that we be,lieved to be rea,sonab,le in 2022 are n,o longer appropria,"te. For example, s",ome
jurisdictions ar,e discontinui,ng incentives fo,r elect,ric vehicles (EV,"s), geopolitical dev",elopments have,led to
greater uncerta,inty in energ,"y forecasts, and",key te,chnologies suc,h as carbon captur,"e, utilization and",storage
(CCUS) have no,t seen antici,pated progress,towar,ds deployment.,"In addition, there a",re significant an,d
continued unce,rtainties abo,ut the climate p,olicies,and regulatory,frameworks in the,jurisdictions we,operate
in. This policy u,ncertainty c,ontinues to risk,slower,momentum on,decarbonization e,fforts going forwa,rd.
"These changes,",among othe,"rs, have had, an",d may,continue to ha,"ve, significant impa",cts on our progre,ss
against our Inte,rim Targets.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Consistent with,our previou,sly disclosed int,ention,to periodically,review our Interim,Targets in light o,f
changing circum,"stances, we",are in the proc,ess of,evaluating our I,nterim Targets to d,etermine if they,remain
appropriate or,should be re,vised. As we rev,iew ou,r Interim Targe,"ts, we will consider",and evaluate ho,w
developments,may impact t,he appropriaten,ess of,our long-term,ambition of net-zer,o in our lending b,"y 2050,"
and whether we,are using a,ppropriate metr,ics to t,rack our progre,ss.,,
