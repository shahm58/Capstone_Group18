Waste,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2024, RBC",diverted 87% of,its waste fro,m landf,ills a,cross ou,r operations,measured in,C,"anada, the U",".S., the"
"UK, continen","tal Europe, Asia",and the Car,ibbean.,This,metric in,cludes opera,tional waste,,– such as sin,gle
stream recyc,"ling, compost, t",rash and shr,edded p,aper,", as well",as electronic,waste – and,,waste from s,pecial
projects. Spe,cifically for ele,ctronic waste,", 481 ton",nes,out of a t,otal of 483 to,nnes were d,i,verted from l,andfill.
This categor,y includes elect,ronic devices,and pe,riphe,"rals, whi",ch are collect,ed by servic,e,providers fo,r

Water use,,,,,,,,,,
"In 2024, RBC",’s water consum,ption intens,ity was 0,.5 m,3/ m2 (202,3: 0.4 m3/ m2;,2022: 0.3 m3/,m,2) . Water us,e
intensity is c,alculated using,RBC’s water,consum,ptio,n divided,by the total f,loor area of,a,ll measured,
properties. T,his includes all,properties fo,r which,we h,ave wate,r consumptio,n data acro,s,"s Canada, th","e U.S.,"
