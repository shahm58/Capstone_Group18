27.,While our approach m,ay evolv,"e over time, we intend to",prioritize allocati,ng c,apital toward s,olutions tha
,will lead to GHG emis,sions red,uctions in Canada and g,lobally. Our invest,ment,commitments,eligible to
,count towards this go,al may al,so include support for cl,imate solutions wi,th o,utcomes linked,to
,"biodiversity, nature a",nd/or ada,"ptation, among others.",We aspire to achie,ve th,is goal by 203,"0; however,"
,"market conditions, am",ong othe,r factors—many of whic,h are beyond our,contr,ol and the effe,cts of which
,can be difficult to pre,dict—cou,ld impact our ability to i,nvest capital to ad,van,ce climate solu,tions over
,this timeframe. Refer,to Appen,dix 8: Caution regarding,forward-looking st,atem,ents and Appe,ndix 9:
,Important notice rega,rding this,report. For purposes of,tracking progress,tow,"ards this goal,",our eligible

33.,The GHG Protocol is t,he leadin,g global corporate stand,ard for measuring,and,managing GH,G emissions.
,To guide companies i,n the task,of identifying and calcu,lating the emissio,ns th,ey create and,contribute to
,across the value chai,"n, the GH",G Protocol Corporate Ac,counting and Repo,rting,Standard cat,egorizes
,emissions into three s,copes. Sc,ope 1 emissions are dir,ect emissions from,own,ed or controll,ed sources.
,Scope 2 emissions ar,e indirect,emissions from the gen,eration of purchas,ed e,nergy. Scope 3,emissions a
,all indirect emissions,not inclu,ded in Scope 2 that occu,r in the value chai,n of,the reporting c,"ompany,"
,including both upstre,am and d,ownstream emissions. T,he GHG Protocol f,urthe,r outlines Sco,pe 3 indirect
,emissions into 15 cate,gories. R,BC measures our Scope,3 emissions relate,d to,business trave,l (category 6
,as part of our operati,onal emis,sion calculations. In 202,"1, we also began m",eas,uring and repo,rting on our
,Scope 3 emissions rel,ated to lo,ans and investments (c,ategory 15) for the,first,"time, also refe",rred to as
,financed emissions.,,,,,,

34.,Our assessment of cli,mate-rela,ted risks and opportuni,ties considers thre,e tim,"e periods, def",ined as shor
,"term (0-3 years), med",ium-term,"(3-5 years), and long-ter",m (5-30 years). Th,e sh,ort- and mediu,m-term time
,periods align with our,financial,performance objective,time horizons; how,eve,"r, timeframes i",n which
,climate-related risks,and oppo,"rtunities manifest vary,",and may extend be,yon,d the tradition,"al strategic,"
