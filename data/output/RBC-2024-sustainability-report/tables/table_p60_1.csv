Our total global operational emis,sions d,ecrease,d by 63% r,elative to our 2018,baseline. T,his is driven by a,7%
"decrease in Scope 1 emissions, a",93% dec,rease i,"n Scope 2,",(market-based) e,"missions, an",d a 33% decreas,e in
our Scope 3 (business travel) em,issions.,The Sc,"ope 2, mark",et-based emissio,ns reduction,of 93% relative,to
the 2018 baseline is due to an inc,rease in,our so,urcing of R,ECs and correspo,nding emissi,"ons reductions,",and
is supported by our efforts to red,uce elec,tricity,consumpti,on from the sourc,"e, which tog",ether amounted,to a
33% reduction of Scope 2 (locatio,n-base,d) emis,sions. The r,emaining balance,"of Scope 2,",market-based,
emissions represent emissions fr,om con,sumed,steam.,,,,

Transition risk,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Risks related to the process of ad,justmen,t towa,rds a low-c,arbon economy. T,hese risks c,an emerge from,
current or future government pol,"icies, le",gislatio,"n, and regu",lation to limit car,bon emissio,"ns, as well as",

Physical risk,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Risks from the increasing severit,y and fre,quenc,y of climate,-related extremes,and events,"(i.e., acute phys",ical
"risks), longer-term gradual shifts",of the c,limate,"(i.e., chroni","c physical risks),",and indirect,effects of clima,te
