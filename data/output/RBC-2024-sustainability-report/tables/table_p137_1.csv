"Oil and gas – Scope
1 & 2 (g CO e/MJ)
2","Canada’s 2030 Emissions
Reduction Plan (ERP)","This Interim Target was informed by Canada’s 2030 ERP,
which is the government’s plan to achieve the country’s
2030 Nationally Determined Contribution under the
Paris Agreement. Even though the ERP does not yet
provide a pathway to net-zero beyond 2030 or a
temperature alignment reflective of a global carbon
budget, we believe the pathway used by the ERP
provides more precise data at a national level and
better aligns with our loan book. (1)
We believe this Interim Target, while not aligned to a
science-based 1.5°C temperature outcome pathway, is
supportive of our ultimate ambition to achieve net-zero
in our lending by 2050, especially in conjunction with the
actions we are taking to reduce our absolute financed
emissions in the sector over time."
"Oil and gas – Scope
3 (g CO e/MJ)
2","International Energy Agency (IEA)
Net-Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario
for the upper bound (29%
reduction by 2030)
RBC policy assessment for the
lower bound (11% reduction by
2030)","We selected the IEA NZE scenario to set the upper-
bound target as the data incorporated by the scenario is
well-suited for determining a pathway to reduce Scope 3
oil and gas emissions. Unlike Scopes 1 and 2, Scope 3
emissions occur globally rather than locally as they are
internationally traded commodities, and a global
scenario such as the IEA scenario was therefore
suitable.
The lower-bound of 11% reduction was based on RBC’s
assessment of the policy landscape in key jurisdictions
and an analysis of our portfolio when the target was
developed. Our ability to achieve this target depends on
the adoption of consistent policies by governments in
those jurisdictions supporting their commitments."
"Power generation –
Scope 1 (g CO e/
2
kWh)",IEA NZE,"We selected the IEA NZE scenario (heat and electricity
generation pathway) to set a Scope 1 target for the power
generation sub-sector."
"Automotive – Scope
1, 2 & 3 tank-to-
wheel (g CO e/km)
2",IEA NZE,"We selected the IEA NZE scenario as the basis to set our
automotive targets. We converted from a sales-based
pathway to an emissions-intensity pathway to translate
the scenario into a pathway suitable to guide our targets."
