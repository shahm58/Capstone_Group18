Emissions fro,m our operations,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Table 16: Glob,al emissions from,our,"operations, for",the year ended Octob,er 31 prov,ides our global ope,ration
emissions for,the last three year,s a,nd our 2018 bas,eline. We report on ou,r operati,onal emissions with,multi-
year data cal,culated in accorda,nce,with the GHG P,rotocol33 for the emiss,ions fro,m our operations for,the
following sco,pes:,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
■ Scope 1 (Dir,ect) – Fuels: Heati,ng f,"uels, such as na",tural gas used to hea,t our bra,"nches, major proper","ties,"
and data ce,ntres. We also incl,ud,e emissions ass,ociated with business,travel in,company-owned an,d
leased mod,es of transportatio,n.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
■ Scope 2 (In,direct) – Electricity,an,d district energy,: Purchased electricit,"y, coolin",g and steam used in,our
"branches, m","ajor properties, d",ata,"centres, and co",-location data centres,. The em,issions associated w,ith ou
electricity c,onsumption depen,d o,n which source,is used to produce el,ectricity i,n each of the jurisdi,ctions
we operate,in.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
■ Scope 3 (In,direct) – Business t,rav,el (Category 6):,Business-related trav,"el, includ","ing by car, rail, and",air.

Restatement,of emissions from,ou,r operations,,,,
,,,,,,,
"In 2024, we re",viewed our metho,dol,ogies for the me,asurement of Scope 2,market-,"based emissions, ag",ainst
the GHG Prot,"ocol33, and for rene",wa,ble electricity ag,ainst RE100 Principle,s. We ide,ntified calculation e,rrors i
our measurem,ent of Scope 2 ma,rke,t-based emissio,ns which have led to,our resta,tement of certain,
operational e,"missions metrics, a",s d,escribed below.,"In addition, as a resu",lt of our,revised goal related,to
renewable ele,ctricity and the rel,ate,d methodology,changes (as describe,d above),", we have restated th",e
percentage of,electricity from re,ne,wable sources to,align with the updat,ed goal a,nd RE100 Principles.,
,,,,,,,
Renewable e,lectricity,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
To align with,our updated goal a,nd,methodology ch,"anges, we have matc",hed all in,direct electricity con,sume
(including ren,"ewable, non-renew",ab,le and non-emit,"ting electricity, measu",red in m,egawatt-hour (MWh,) with
RECs. We had,previously only m,atc,hed our non-ren,ewable and non-emitt,ing elect,ricity consumption w,ith
RECs. The per,centage of electric,ity,from renewable,sources has been res,tated as,a result.,
,,,,,,,
We replaced t,he prior metric on,ele,ctricity sourced,from renewable and,non-emitt,ing sources with the,
percentage of,electricity from re,ne,wable sources.,We also restated our e,lectricity,sourced from renew,able
sources from,100% to 58% in 202,3 t,o reflect our upd,ated methodology.,,,
,,,,,,,
Scope 2 mark,et-based,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
GHG emission,s reductions from,RE,"Cs (tCOe) and r
2",elated Scope 2 marke,t-based e,"missions (tCOe) ha
2",ve als
been restated,"for 2023, 2022, an",d o,ur 2018 baseline,as a result of updates,to our m,ethodology to align,with
the GHG Prot,ocol33. Similar to RE,10,"0 Principles, the",GHG Protocol require,s an enti,ty to match total ele,ctricit
consumption,"with RECs, rather t",ha,n only electricity,from non-renewable,and non-,"emitting sources, w",hich w
had previousl,y done. In addition,", w",e had previously,matched energy con,sumed fr,om steam with RECs,", whic"
is not aligned,with the GHG Prot,oco,l.,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
We restated G,HG emissions red,ucti,ons from RECs (,"tCOe) from 63,713 to
2","48,871 in","2023, from 35,379 to","21,843"
"in 2022, and fr","om 4,718 to 8,048 i",n 2,018 as a result o,f updates to our meth,odology.,"Scope 2, market-bas",ed
emissions are,a product of GHG,em,issions reductio,"ns from RECs, and we",re also r,estated as a result.,
