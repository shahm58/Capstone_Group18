,,,,,,,
(1) RBC Capital Mark,"ets clients, as described",in RBC’,s Client Engagement App,roach on Climate – Energy Sec,tor. The estimate of the por,tfolio impacted by clien,ts that
have withdrawn o,r reduced disclosures do,es not a,ccount for portfolio mer,gers and acquisitions (M&A) ac,"tivity; for example, a client",would not be included,in the
‘clients that have,withdrawn or reduced di,sclosur,es’ population if they had,a disclosure in 2023 but were,subsequently acquired by,a client who withdrew o,r reduced
disclosure in 2024,.,,,,,,
(2) No clients met th,e Advanced maturity ban,d criteri,a in 2023 or 2024. Progre,ssing to the Advanced band is,challenging for most client,"s, as the criteria includ",es having
1.5ºC aligned targ,ets.,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
Our clients con,tinue to navigat,e an,evolving regula,tory and legal envir,"onment, including",amendments,to the
Competition A,"ct (Canada), as",descr,ibed in About th,is Report. 34% of ou,r oil and gas sect,or clients (on a,n
authorized exp,osure basis) ha,ve w,ithdrawn or red,uced the scope of th,eir climate and s,ustainability-re,lated
disclosures sin,ce our 2023 ass,essm,"ent, or have ad",ded disclaimers that,the disclosure is,for informatio,nal
purposes only.,Because we ca,nnot,accurately asse,ss the maturity ban,"d of those clients,",we have remo,ved
them from the,maturity bands,and,shown them as ‘,clients who have wi,thdrawn disclosu,res’ in Figure 2,above.
This has only i,mpacted 2024 d,ata;,"however, for co","mparability, we have",also shown the 2,023 impact. W,e will
continue to rev,iew our approa,ch in,assessing clien,t plans in light of th,eir limited disclos,ure.,
,,,,,,,
The exposure t,o Non-committe,d cli,ents decreased,year-over-year from,"15% to 7%, as se",t out in Figure 2,
above. Drivers,of this progress,incl,ude successful e,ngagement with cli,"ents, who began d",isclosing emis,sions
and plans to re,duce them. Man,y of,our Non-commi,tted clients are own,ed by private equ,ity firms. In so,me
"cases, we enga",ged directly wit,h the,se private equit,"y firms, who were a",lready working wi,th their portfol,io
companies on,emissions reduc,tion,initiatives and,were well positioned,to provide us wit,h information,
related to thes,e initiatives. M&,A ac,tivity was also a,factor as clients wi,th more robust cl,imate plans ac,quired
"smaller, less m",ature clients wh,o m,ay not have had,a similar plan.,,,
,,,,,,,
The remaining,Non-committed,clien,ts in our portfo,lio tend to be relativ,ely small private,"clients, new",
"companies, or",royalty compan,ies. N,ewer companie,"s (e.g., recently for",med) are often to,o early in their,
journey to hav,e formulated a c,lima,"te plan, but are",a good example of a,client type that i,s often recepti,ve to
climate engag,ement. Royalty c,omp,anies differ from,operators as they,largely act as a fi,nancial service,
provider. They,do not have dir,ect c,ontrol over the e,missions that resul,t from the underl,ying oil and gas,
assets. As a re,"sult, it is more d",ifficu,lt for these clien,ts to progress thro,ugh the maturity b,ands.,
,,,,,,,
We also explor,ed other challen,ges,relevant to clien,ts in other maturity,"bands, including",methane abat,ement
and Scope 3 e,missions reporti,ng. W,e continue to d,eepen our understa,nding on these to,pics through,
research and b,y engaging with,clie,nts and industry,experts. Our observ,ation is that in b,"oth areas,",
inconsistency,of calculation a,nd re,porting method,ologies with limited,standardized gui,dance is a defin,ing
challenge for o,ur clients. We w,ill co,ntinue to work,with our clients and,non-government,al organization,s to
understand th,e opportunities,and c,hallenges of the,se topics.,,,
