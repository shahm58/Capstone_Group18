(2) In addition to R,BC’s and RBC Foundation’s ow,"n calculations, we engaged L",ondon Bench,marking Group (LBG),Canada to assess o,ur data and calculat,e our Canadian
community inve,stments using methodology u,nder the LBG measurement fr,"amework, wh",ich helps to account f,or the broader impa,cts of our financial,contribution.
LBG is a networ,k of corporate community inv,estment professionals that w,ork together t,"o apply, develop and",enhance the LBG me,asurement framew,ork. Since there
are no generally,accepted accounting princip,les to inform how community,investments,"are reported, differen",t companies have hi,storically taken diff,erent
approaches to a,rrive at their numbers. The L,BG measurement framework p,rovides an ap,proach to measuring,the real value and i,mpact of corporate,community
investment to b,oth business and society. As a,"n external third party, LBG C",anada provide,s a standardized app,roach to valuing co,mmunity investmen,ts and reviews
each participan,t’s reported community inves,tments to verify whether or no,t the approac,h has been followed.,,,
